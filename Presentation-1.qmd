## Introduction & TOC



## Problem

-   Global rise in demand for mental health services coinciding with significant resource challenges

-   In Ontario, 90% increase in mental health conditions requiring hospitalization–many of which might have been prevented with early intervention

-   Underscores the need for a tool that supports clinical decision making by anticipating crisis relapse

## Solution: A hybrid time-series model

-   Prior work looked at utilizing structured data to model acute events like suicide or substance use relapse

-   Continuous prediction of crisis–across related disorders–using a combination of data was a novel idea

<!-- -->

-   What if we could combine unstructured and structured EMHR to predict crisis events?

## Structured vs unstructured data

Structured = tabular data

Unstructured = clinical notes

## Electronic health data - challenges

-   Sparseness

-   Nested structure - interdependencies

-   Multicollinearity

-   Missing data both at random and systematically

-   Data quality / mistakes

-   Subjective nature of MH data

-   Concept of structured versus unstructured data

## Critical analyses

-   compelling case for inclusion of unstructured data when modeling EHR using a hybrid ensemble approach

-   The scores tells us that while the model can identify crises better than random guessing, the model may still flag many non-crisis events that could potentially overburden clinicians [\[1\]](http://localhost:7085/?quartoPreviewReqId=1730374746756&quartoPreviewThemeCategory=dark#ref-garriga2023). A more thorough discussion of the model’s threshold for clinical utility would have been good to see and is perhaps in the works. In their earlier study they conducted a post-hoc cohort study to examine clinical utility in everyday practice which would have been nice to see here too
