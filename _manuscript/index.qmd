# **Introduction and Motivation**

This review analyzes the study by Garriga et al. (2023), published in *Cell Medical*, titled *"Combining Clinical Notes with Structured Electronic Health Records Enhances the Prediction of Mental Health Crises."* The research investigates the utility of combining unstructured clinical notes with structured data from electronic mental health records (EMHR) to improve the prediction of mental health crises. The relevance of @garriga2023 study is underscored by an alarming rise in mental health-related hospitalizations coinciding with significant resource and workforce challenges. Recent data highlights that hospitalizations for mental health conditions, particularly among youth in Ontario, have surged since the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health crises requiring hospitalization (e.g., emotional breakdowns, substance overdoses and suicide attempts) have increased \_\_-fold. What's worse, many of these crises might have been prevented with early intervention. However a lack of predictive tools has made it difficult for healthcare systems to anticipate and address these crises before they peak.

Leveraging Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to bolster clinical decision-making is not new, as clinicians and researchers have long utilized structured data like diagnosis codes, lab results, and medication records, to inform predictive models and treatment strategies. However, due to computational restraints and .... , unstructured data like clinical notes and other free-form text and imagery until recently has been left largely untapped. Considering this form of data constitutes a substantial portion of EHRs in terms of volume and contains critical narrative information like clinician observations, patient-reported symptoms, and contextual details surrounding patient interactions that structured data might lack, by incorporating this textual data into predictive models.....

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of the study was to predict mental health crises utilizing both structured and unstructured mental health data.

When a patient is admitted to acute care with a mental crisis it might be their first visit or the most recent in a long history of crisis events. At each event, a mix of information is collected including structured data comprised of discrete variables (i.e., gender, diagnoses, and school district), continuous variables (i.e., standardized assessment scores) and administrative data (i.e., number of visits, hours of service) and time based data like intake, discharge and assessment dates.

The main challenge posed by these data was the clinical reality that the information contained in any one EHR varied significantly from patient to patient. Moreover, clincian-level idosyncricies like personal style, work habits and clinical modality meant that the quality, availability and volume of clinical notes in EHRs was highly inconsistent. Moreover, the severity and frequency of a patients mental health crises was related to the volume of notes within the EHR, meaning that those with more severe or recurrent episodes typically had a greater volume of clinical notes. As such, it was important that to establish the minimum quantity of unstructured data that would contribute to the accurate prediction of mental health crises and still remain effective across a spectrum of patient complexity, regardless of the volume of clinical notes.

How would they contend with this probleM?

## **Solution**

-   Detail the paper's **significant contribution to the subject.**
-   The study extends their previous work that analyzed 60000 de-identified patient records collected over eight years to predict mental health crisis within the next 28 days following a weekly algorithm prediction. They extended this work in three ways: i) compared the predictive power of unstructured data alone with structured data; ii) improve the performance of the earlier prediction model by comparing different methods for combining structured and unstructured data; iii) investigate the minimum availability of unstructured data that improves model fit.
