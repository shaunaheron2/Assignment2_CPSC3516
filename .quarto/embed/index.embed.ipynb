    "The main goal of your review is to **convey the core ideas and key findings presented in the paper**.\n",

    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This review analyzes the study by Garriga et al. (2023), published in *Cell Medical*, titled *“Combining Clinical Notes with Structured Electronic Health Records Enhances the Prediction of Mental Health Crises.”* The research investigates the utility of combining unstructured clinical notes with structured data from electronic mental health records (EMHR) to improve the prediction of mental health crises.\n",
    "\n",
    "While leveraging EHRs to bolster clinical decision-making is not new, previous work has mainly focused on predicting specific events like suicide attempts or substance relapse–representing only a small subset of mental health demand. In @garriga2023 earlier paper, they demonstrated the added value of continuous prediction of mental health crises with structured data, but in this paper they take their work further to examine the relatively unexplored power of utilizing clinical notes which typically dominate in terms of volumne when compared to structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevance of @garriga2023 study is underscored by an alarming rise in mental health-related hospitalizations coinciding with significant resource and workforce challenges. Recent data highlights that hospitalizations for mental health conditions, particularly among youth in Ontario, have surged since the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health crises requiring hospitalization (e.g., emotional breakdowns, substance overdoses and suicide attempts) have increased \\_\\_-fold. What’s worse, many of these crises might have been prevented with early intervention. However a lack of predictive tools has made it difficult for healthcare systems to anticipate and address these crises before they peak.\n",
